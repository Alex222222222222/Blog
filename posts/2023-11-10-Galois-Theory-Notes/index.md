## Intro

This is my personal note for Galois Theory.

## Concepts of Ring

<div class="math_definition_env">
<span id="definition:ring" className="math_definition">Ring</span>
is a set equipped with two binary operations, usually referred to as
addition $+$ and multiplication $·$,
that satisfy the following conditions:

1. The set is an abelian group under the operation $+$
   with an identity element usually denoted as 0.

2. The operation $·$ is associative,
   meaning that for all $a, b, c$ in the set, $(a·b)·c$ equals $a·(b·c)$.

3. The operation $·$ is distributive over the operation $+$,
   meaning that for all $a, b, c$ in the set, $a·(b+c)$ equals
   $a·b + a·c$ and $(a+b)·c$ equals $a·c + b·c$.

4. The operation $·$ has an identity element, usually denoted as $1$.

5. The operation $·$ is closed, meaning that for all $a, b$ in the set,
$a·b$ is also in the set.

6. A ring is called a commutative ring if the operation $·$ is commutative,
   meaning that for all $a, b$ in the set, $a·b$ equals $b·a$.

<div class="math_definition_env">
<span id="definition:field" class="math_definition"> Field </span>
is a ring in which every non-zero element is invertible.
</div>

<div class="math_definition_env">
<span id="definition:subring" class="math_definition"> Subring </span>
is a subset of a ring
that is a ring with the restriction of the ring operations.
</div>

<div class="math_definition_env">
<span id="definition:subfield" class="math_definition"> Subfield </span>
is a subset of a field
that is a field with the restriction of the field operations.
</div>

<div class="math_definition_env">
<span id="definition:ring-homomorphism" class="math_definition"> Ring Homomorphism </span>
is a function between two rings
that preserves the operations of the rings.

A ring homomorphism is called an
<span id="definition:ring-homomorphism:isomorphism" class="math_definition"> isomorphism </span>
if it is bijective.
</div>

<div class="math_definition_env">
<span id="definition:ring-homomorphism" class="math_definition"> Ideal </span>
is a subset of a ring that is closed under addition, negation,
and multiplication by any element in the ring.
</div>

<div class="math_definition_env">
<span id="definition:ring-homomorphism" class="math_definition"> Principal Ideal </span>
is an ideal that is generated by a single element.
</div>

<div class="math_definition_env">
<span id="definition:integral-domain" class="math_definition"> Integral Domain </span>
is a commutative ring with identity
in which the product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero.
</div>

<div class="math_definition_env">
<span id="definition:quotient-ring" class="math_definition"> Quotient Ring </span>
is a ring constructed from a ring $R$ and an ideal $I$ of $R$.
Where the elements of the quotient ring are the cosets of $I$ in $R$.
</div>
