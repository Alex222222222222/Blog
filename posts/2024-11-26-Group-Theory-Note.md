# Group Theory Note

## Introduction

This is my personal note on group theory.

## Abelian Group

In this section, we will only focus on Abelian groups.
And we will use the additive notation for the group operation.

### Divisible and Reduced Groups

::math-env-start{definition}

A group $G$ is called **divisible** if for every $a \in G$ and every positive integer $n$, there exists an element $b \in G$ such that $nb = a$.

::math-env-start{example}

The group $\mathbb{Z}(p^\infty)$ is divisible.
