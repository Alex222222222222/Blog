# Group Theory Note

## Introduction

This is my personal note on group theory.

## Group Actions

### Orbit and Stabilizer

### Burnside's Lemma

#### Group With $2$ Conjugacy Classes

Group $G$ with $2$ conjugacy classes, are particularly interesting.
As only finite groups have $2$ conjugacy classes, well be $C_2$.
And any group with $2$ conjugacy classes is simple.
Thus, it may serve as a good example to infinite simple groups.

::math-env-start{theorem}

If $G$ is a group with $2$ conjugacy classes, then $G$ is simple.

::math-env-end{theorem}

::math-env-start{proof}

As $1$ itself is a conjugacy class, the other conjugacy class must be all the other elements.

Let $N$ be a non-trivial normal subgroup of $G$.
Take $x \in N$ such that $x\neq 1$.
Then for any $y\in G$, $y\neq 1$,
there exists $g\in G$ such that $gxg^{-1} = y$.
Thus, $N=G$.

::math-env-end{proof}

::math-env-start{theorem}

If $G$ is a finite group with $2$ conjugacy classes, then $G$ is isomorphic to $C_2$.

::math-env-end{theorem}

::math-env-start{proof}

As $1$ itself is a conjugacy class, the other conjugacy class must be all the other elements.

By Burnside's lemma, we have the following equation:
$$
2 = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}|C(g)| = 1 + \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\neq 1, g \in G}|C(g)|.
$$
Where $C(g) = \{x\in G \mid gxg^{-1} = x\}$, which is the elements that is fixed by $g$.
As $g$ must fix $1$ and itself, thus, for any $g\neq 1$, $|C(g)| \ge 2$.

Therefore, we have the following inequality:
$$
2= 1 + \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\neq 1, g \in G}|C(g)| \ge 1 + \frac{2}{|G|}(|G|-1) = 2.
$$
Which then gives us the equality:
$$
|G| \le 2.
$$

::math-env-end{proof}


## Abelian Group

In this section, we will only focus on Abelian groups.
And we will use the additive notation for the group operation.

### Free Abelian Group

::math-env-start{definition}

An Abelian group $F$ is **free Abelian** if it is a direct sum of infinite cyclic groups.
More precisely, there is a subset $X \subseteq F$ of elements of infinite order,
called a **basis** of $F$, with $F = \sum_{x\in X}$; i.e., $F = \sum\mathbb{Z}$.

::math-env-end{definition}

::math-env-start{theorem}

There is an infinite p-primary group $\mathbb{Z}(p^{\infty})$
each of whose proper subgroups is finite and cyclic.

::math-env-end{theorem}

::math-env-start{proof}

We define a group $G$ have generators:
$$
X = \{x_0,x_1,\dots,x_i,\dots\}, i\in\mathbb{N}
$$
with relations:
$$
\{
    px_0, x_0 - px_1, x_1 - px_2, \dots, x_i - px_{i+1}, \dots
\}
$$

We let $F$ be the free Abelian group generated by $X$.
And let $R \le F$ be the subgroup generated by the relations.
Let $a_i = x_i + R \in F/R = G$, as $\{x_0,x_1,\dots\}$ form a basis of $F$,
$\{a_0,a_1,\dots\}$ form a basis of $G$.
And as $pa_0 = 0$, $pa_1 = a_0$, $pa_2 = a_1$, $\dots$,
for every $a_i$, we have $p^{i+1}a_i = 0$. So $G$ is a p-primary group.

To prove $G$ is infinite, we prove that $a_i$ are distinct.
Assume $a_i = a_j$ for some $i< j$.
Then by previous reasoning, we have $a_i = p^{j-i} a_j$,
which implies $(p^{j-i}-1) a_j= 0$.
And previous reasoning also shows that $p^{j+1}a_j = 0$.
Thus, the order of $a_j$ must divides $\gcd(p^{j+1} , p^{j-i}-1) = 1$.
Which implies $a_j = 0$, which is a contradiction.

Take $H$ to be a proper subgroup of $G$.
By previous argument, for all $j< i$,
$a_j$ is in the cyclic group generated by $a_i$.
Thus, we have
$$
    G = \bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty} \langle a_i \rangle.
$$
If $H$ is finite, then there must be $n$ such that $H \subseteq \langle a_n \rangle$.
Then $H$ is a subgroup of finite and cyclic group, thus $H$ is finite and cyclic.

If $H$ is infinite, then there must be a sequence of elements in $H$,
say $\{h_1, h_2, \dots\}$, such that $h_i \in \langle a_{n_i} \rangle$,
and $h_i \notin \langle a_{n_i-1} \rangle$.
Assume $h_i = ka_{n_i}$,
then $\gcd(k,p)$ must be $1$,
as otherwise $h_i$ will be in $\langle a_{n_i-1} \rangle$.
Then $h_i$ also generate $\langle a_{n_i} \rangle$,
which implies $a_{n_i} \in H$.
And thus, $a_i \in H, \forall i$, which implies $H = G$.

::math-env-end{proof}

### Divisible and Reduced Groups

::math-env-start{definition}

A group $G$ is called **divisible** if for every $a \in G$ and every positive integer $n$, there exists an element $b \in G$ such that $nb = a$.

::math-env-end{definition}

::math-env-start{example}

The group $\mathbb{Z}(p^\infty)$ is divisible.

We define a group $\mathbb{Z}(p^\infty)$ have generators:
$$
X = \{x_0,x_1,\dots,x_i,\dots\}, i\in\mathbb{N}
$$
with relations:
$$
\{
    px_0, x_0 - px_1, x_1 - px_2, \dots, x_i - px_{i+1}, \dots
\}
$$

We let $F$ be the free Abelian group generated by $X$.
And let $R \le F$ be the subgroup generated by the relations.
Let $a_i = x_i + R \in F/R = G$, as $\{x_0,x_1,\dots\}$ form a basis of $F$,
$\{a_0,a_1,\dots\}$ form a basis of $G$.
Also, $pa_0 = 0$, $pa_1 = a_0$, $pa_2 = a_1$, $\dots$,
therefore we have,
for all $j< i$,
$a_j$ is in the cyclic group generated by $a_i$.
Thus, we have
$$
    G = \bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty} \langle a_i \rangle.
$$

We take $n=p^r m$ such that $\gcd(p,m)=1$.
Then for any element $b \in \mathbb{Z}(p^\infty)$,
we have $n$ such that $b \in \langle a_n \rangle$.
Assume $b = ka_n$,
we also take $c = ka_{n+r}$.
Then, by the relation of generators, we have $p^r c = b$.
As $m$ is co-prime with $p$,
by BÃ©zout's identity, there exists $x,y$ such that $mx + p^{n+r+1}y = 1$.
We take $d = xc$.
Then
$$
\begin{aligned}
nd &= p^r m xc \\
& = p^r(1-p^{n+r+1}y)c \\
& = p^r c - p^{n+2r+1}y c \\
& = b - 0 \\
& = b.
\end{aligned}
$$
Which finish the proof that $\mathbb{Z}(p^\infty)$ is divisible.

::math-env-end{example}

::math-env-start{theorem}[name="Injective Property, Baer, 1940"]

Let $D$ be a divisible group and let $A$ be a subgroup of a group $B$.
If $f: A \rightarrow D$ is a homomorphism,
then $f$ can be extended to a homomorphism $\phi: B \rightarrow D$;
that is, the following diagram commutes:

```tikz
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=huge]
   & D\\
   0\ar[r] & A \ar[u,"f"]\ar[r,hookrightarrow,"i"] & B\ar[ul, dashed, "\varphi"]
\end{tikzcd}
```

::math-env-end{theorem}

::math-env-start{proof}

This theorem can be proved by Zorn's lemma, or an equivalent proof of well-ordering principle.

Consider $\mathcal{F}$ to be the set of all pairs $(C, g)$,
where $C$ is a subgroup of $B$ containing $A$ and $g: C \rightarrow D$ is a homomorphism extending $f$.
Note that $\mathcal{F}$ is non-empty as $(A,f) \in \mathcal{F}$.

We define a partial order on $\mathcal{F}$ by $(C_1, g_1) \le (C_2, g_2)$ if $C_1 \subseteq C_2$ and $g_2|_{C_1} = g_1$.
Then for any chain $\{(C_i, g_i)\}_{i\in I}$ in $\mathcal{F}$,
we can define $C = \bigcup_{i\in I} C_i$ and $g: C \rightarrow D$ by $g(c) = g_i(c)$ for $c\in C_i$.
It is easy to check $g$ is well-defined and $g$ is a homomorphism.
Thus, $(C,g)$ is an upper bound of the chain.

By Zorn's lemma, there exists a maximal element $(B', g')$ in $\mathcal{F}$.
If $B' \neq B$, then there exists $b \in B \setminus B'$.
And we discuss whether $B'\cap \langle b \rangle=0$.

If $B'\cap \langle b \rangle=0$, then we can extend $g'$ to $B' + \langle b \rangle$ by defining $g'(b) = 0$.
Which contradicts the maximality of $B'$.

If $B'\cap \langle b \rangle \neq 0$, then we can take $k$ to be the smallest positive integer such that $kb \in B'$.
Then as $D$ is divisible, we can find $d \in D$ such that $kd = kb$.
Then we can extend $g'$ to $B' + \langle b \rangle$ by defining $g'(b) = d$.
And it is easy to check that $g'$ is a homomorphism.
Which contradicts the maximality of $B'$.

::math-env-end{proof}

Follows from the injective property, we have the following corollary:

::math-env-start{corollary}

If a divisible group $D$ is a subgroup of a group $B$,
then $D$ is a direct summand of $B$.

::math-env-end{corollary}

::math-env-start{proof}

We consider the following diagram:

```tikz
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=huge]
   & D\\
   0\ar[r] & D \ar[u,"1_D"]\ar[r,hookrightarrow,"i"] & B\ar[ul, dashed, "\varphi"]
\end{tikzcd}
```

As $D$ is divisible, we can extend $1_D$ to $\varphi: B \rightarrow D$.
By theorem in group extension, we have $B = D \oplus \ker \varphi$.

::math-env-end{proof}

::math-env-start{definition}

If $G$ is a group, then $dG$ is the subgroup of $G$ generated by all divisible subgroups of $G$.

::math-env-end{definition}

Note that $dG$ is invariant under all automorphism of $G$.
As image of any divisible subgroup is also divisible.

::math-env-start{lemma}

For any group $F$, $dG$ is the unique maximal divisible subgroup of $G$.

::math-env-end{lemma}

::math-env-start{proof}

We first prove that $dG$ is divisible.
For any $a \in dG$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$,
there exists $H$ which is a divisible subgroup of $G$ such that $a \in H$.
As $H$ is divisible, there exists $b \in H$ such that $nb = a$.
And as $H$ is a subgroup of $dG$, $b \in dG$.

The maximal is obvious,
as if there exists a divisible subgroup $H$ such that $dG \subset H \subset G$,
then $H \subset dG$, by the definition of $dG$.

It is unique as if there exists another maximal divisible subgroup $H$,
then $\langle H, dG \rangle$ is also a divisible subgroup,
then $\langle H, dG \rangle \subset dG$.

::math-env-end{proof}

::math-env-start{definition}

A group $G$ is called **reduced** if $dG = 0$.

::math-env-end{definition}

::math-env-start{theorem}

For every group $G$, there exists a decomposition $G = dG \oplus R$,
where $dG$ is divisible and $R$ is reduced.

::math-env-end{theorem}

::math-env-start{proof}

Since $dG$ is divisible, by corollary of injective property, $dG$ is a direct summand of $G$. Thus, there exists $R\le G$ such that $G = dG \oplus R$.

Next, we prove that $R$ is reduced.
If $R$ is not reduced, then there exists a non-zero element $r \in R$ such that
for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $r$ is divisible by $n$.
Then take an element $a \in dG$, then $a+r \in dG \oplus R$ is also divisible by $n$
for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
Which contradicts the maximally of $dG$.

::math-env-end{proof}

> Every abelian group is an extension of the torsion group $tG$ by a torsion free subgroup, but $tG$ need not to be a direct summand of $G$.
> However, $dG$ is a direct summand of $G$.

::math-env-start{definition}

Given a group $G$ define $G[n] = \{x\in G \mid nx = 0\}$.

::math-env-end{definition}

::math-env-start{lemma}

If $G$ and $H$ are divisible p-primary group, then $G \cong H$
if and only if $G[p] \cong H[p]$.

::math-env-end{lemma}

::math-env-start{proof}

The "only if" part is obvious.
For the "if" part, we define $\phi: G[p] \rightarrow H[p]$,
to be the isomorphism between $G[p]$ and $H[p]$.
Then $\phi$ is also a homomorphism from $G[p]$ to $H$.
By previous lemma, we can extend $\phi$ to a homomorphism $\Phi: G \rightarrow H$.
And we prove that $\Phi$ is injective first.

For injectivity, we prove this by induction on $n \ge 1$,
that if $p^n x = 0$, and $\Phi(x) = 0$, then $x = 0$.
The base case $n=1$ is obvious, as now $x \in G[p]$,
which means $0=\Phi(x) = \phi(x)$, and as $\phi$ is isomorphic,
$x = 0$.
Now we assume the statement is true for $n-1$,
and we prove it for $n$.
If $p^n x = 0$, then $p^{n-1} (px) = 0$,
also $\Phi(x) = 0$ must implies $\Phi(px) = 0$,
thus by the induction hypothesis, $px = 0$,
which implies $x = 0$ by the base case.

As $\Phi$ is injective, $\Phi: G \rightarrow \text{Im}(\Phi)$ is an isomorphism.
And we define $\phi': \text{Im}(\Phi) \rightarrow G$ as the inverse of $\Phi$.
Also, note that the inverse of $\phi'$ extends the inverse of $\phi$,
as it is easy to check $\phi'\mid H[p] = \phi^{-1}$.
As $\phi'$ is a homomorphism from a subgroup of $H$ to $G$,
by previous lemma, we can extend $\phi'$ to a homomorphism $\Phi': H \rightarrow G$.
As $\phi'$ is a surjection by definition, $\Phi'$ is also a surjection.
And also as $\Phi'$ extends $\phi^{-1}$,
apply a similar reasoning as above, we have $\Phi'$ is injective.
Thus, $\Phi'$ is an isomorphism. 

::math-env-end{proof}

::math-env-start{theorem}

Every divisible group $D$ is a direct sum of copies of
$\mathbb{Q}$ and of copies of $\mathbb{Z}(p^\infty)$ for various primes $p$.

::math-env-end{theorem}

::math-env-start{proof}

It is easy to check that $tD$, the torsion group of $D$ is divisible,
so $tD$ is a direct summand of $D$.
Thus, there exists $V \subset D$ such that $D= tD \oplus V$.
As now $V$ is torsion free, and divisible, it is a vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$,
and thus, $V$ is a direct sum of copies of $\mathbb{Q}$.

Now we prove that $tD$ is a direct sum of copies of $\mathbb{Z}(p^\infty)$,
for various primes $p$.
For prime $p$, let $B_p = \{
    x \in tD \mid p^nx = 0 \text{ for some } n \in \mathbb{N}
\}$.
Then $B_p$ is a divisible p-primary group.
It is easy to check that $tD = \bigoplus_{p} B_p$.
So, we only focus on $B_p$.

It is easy to check that the group $B_p[p]$ is now a vector space over $\mathbb{F}_p$,
let $r_p$ be the dimension of $B_p[p]$.
By previous lemma, $B_p$ is isomorphic to direct sum of $r_p$ copies of $\mathbb{Z}(p^\infty)$.

::math-env-end{proof}

There is an analogy between theorems about free Abelian groups and divisible groups,
that may be formalized as follows.
Given a commutative diagram containing exact sequences,
then its **dual diagram** is the diagram obtained by reversing all the arrows.
For example, the dual diagram of $0 \rightarrow A \rightarrow B$ is $B^* \rightarrow A^* \rightarrow 0$,
and this leads on the say that "subgroup" and "quotient" are dual concepts.

::math-env-start{theorem}

Every group $G$ can be embedded in a divisible group $D$.

::math-env-end{theorem}

::math-env-start{proof}

As every Abelian group can be written as $F/R$,
where $F$ is a free Abelian group and $R$ is a subgroup of $F$.
Now $F = \sum \mathbb{Z}$, so that $F \le \sum \mathbb{Q}$.
Hence, $G = F/R = (\sum\mathbb{Z})/R \le (\sum\mathbb{Q})/R$.
As $(\sum\mathbb{Q})/R$ is a quotient of a divisible group, it is divisible.

::math-env-end{proof}

::math-env-start{corollary}

A group $G$ is divisible if and only if it is a direct summand of any group containing it.

::math-env-end{corollary}

::math-env-start{proof}

By previous theorem, we can embed $G$ in a divisible group $D$.
Then $G$ is a direct summand of $D$.
And any direct summand of divisible group is divisible.

::math-env-end{proof}

#### Exercises

::math-env-start{exercise}

If $0 \rightarrow A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow 0$
is an exact sequence and if $A$ and $C$ are reduced,
then $B$ is reduced.

::math-env-end{exercise}

::math-env-start{proof}

We name the maps in the exact sequence as follows:

```tikz
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=huge]
   0\ar[r] & A \ar[r,"i"] & B \ar[r,"j"] & C \ar[r] & 0
\end{tikzcd}
```

As $i$ is injective, we now assume $A \le B$.
Assume $B$ is not reduced, then $dB \neq 0$.
Then, $j(dB)$ is divisible, as it is a quotient of divisible group.
Because $C$ is reduced, $j(dB) = 0$,
which implies, $dB \le \ker j = \text{Im} i = A$.
As $A$ is reduced, $dB = 0$.

::math-env-end{proof}

::math-env-start{exercise}

- Prove that $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z} = \sum_p \mathbb{Z}(p^\infty)$.
- Prove that $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}[n] \cong \mathbb{Z}_n$.

::math-env-end{exercise}

::math-env-start{proof}

As $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ is a quotient of divisible group, it is divisible.
Also given $\frac{a}{b} \in \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$,
we have $b \frac{a}{b} = 0$.
Thus, $t\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$,
and $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ contains no summand of $\mathbb{Q}$.

It is easy to check that:

$$
    \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}[p] = \{
        \frac{a}{b} \in \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z} \mid \gcd(a,b) = 1, b = p
    \}.
$$

Then it is a cyclic group of order $p$,
which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}(p^\infty)[p]$.
Then by previous theorem and lemma, we have, $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z} = \sum_p \mathbb{Z}(p^\infty)$.

For the second part, we factorize $n = p_1^{r_1} \dots p_k^{r_k}$.
Then we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}[n] &= (\sum_p \mathbb{Z}(p^\infty))[n] \\
    &= \sum_p (\mathbb{Z}(p^\infty)[n]) \\
    &= \sum_{i = 1}^{k} (\mathbb{Z}(p_i^\infty)[p_i^{r_i}]) \\
    &= \sum_{i = 1}^{k} \mathbb{Z}_{p_i^{r_i}} \\
    &= \mathbb{Z}_n.
\end{aligned}
$$

::math-env-end{proof}

::math-env-start{exercise}

Prove that a group $G$ is divisible if and only if $G$ has
the injective property.

::math-env-end{exercise}

::math-env-start{proof}

The "only if" part is given by previous theorem.
For the "if" part, we prove that if a group $D$ contains $G$,
$G$ is a direct summand of $D$.
And then by previous corollary, $G$ is divisible.

By injective property, we have the following diagram,
where $\varphi$ is an extension of $1_G$.

```tikz
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=huge]
   & G\\
   0\ar[r] & G \ar[u,"1_G"]\ar[r,hookrightarrow,"i"] & D\ar[ul, dashed, "\varphi"]
\end{tikzcd}
```

Then by previous theorem about group extension,
$G$ is a direct summand of $D$.

::math-env-end{proof}

::math-env-start{exercise}

A group $G$ is divisible if and only if $G = pG$ for all prime $p$.

::math-env-end{exercise}

::math-env-start{proof}

If $G$ is divisible,
then for any element $g \in G$, as $G$ is divisible,
there exists $h \in G$ such that $ph = g$.
Thus, we have $G \le pG$.
And as $pG \le G$ obviously, we have $G = pG$.

Then, if $G = pG$ for all prime $p$,
then for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$,
we do induction on $n$.
The base case $n=1$ is obvious,
any element $g \in G$ is divisible by $1$.
Now we assume that any element $g \in G$ is divisible by all natural numbers less than $n$,
and we prove that $g$ is divisible by $n$.
If $n$ is a prime, then as $G = nG$, there exists $h \in G$ such that $nh = g$.
If $n$ is not a prime, then there exists $n_1 \neq 1$ and $n_2 \neq 1$ such that $n = n_1 n_2$.
As $g$ is now divisible by $n_1$ by induction hypothesis,
there exists $h_1 \in G$ such that $n_1 h_1 = g$.
And as $h_1$ is now divisible by $n_2$ by induction hypothesis,
there exists $h_2 \in G$ such that $n_2 h_2 = h_1$.
Thus, $n h_2 = g$.

::math-env-end{proof}

::math-env-start{exercise}

A $p$-primary group $G$ is divisible if and only if $G=pG$.

::math-env-end{exercise}

::math-env-start{proof}

If $G$ is divisible,
then for any element $g \in G$, as $G$ is divisible,
there exists $h \in G$ such that $ph = g$.
Thus, we have $G \le pG$.
And as $pG \le G$ obviously, we have $G = pG$.

Then, if $G = pG$,
then for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$,
we do induction on $n$.
The base case $n=1$ is obvious,
any element $g \in G$ is divisible by $1$.
Now we assume that any element $g \in G$ is divisible by
all natural numbers less than $n$,
and we prove that $g$ is divisible by $n$.
If $n = p$,
then as $G = pG$, there exists $h \in G$ such that $ph = g$.
If $n$ is a prime that is not $p$,
then we assume the order of $g$ is $p^r$,
and by BÃ©zout identity, there exists $x,y$ such that $p^rx + ny = 1$.
Then we have $n (yg) = ny g = (1-p^rx)g = g$, thus $g$ is divisible by $n$.
If $n$ is not a prime,
then there exists $n_1 \neq 1$ and $n_2 \neq 1$ such that $n = n_1 n_2$.
As $g$ is now divisible by $n_1$ by induction hypothesis,
there exists $h_1 \in G$ such that $n_1 h_1 = g$.
And as $h_1$ is now divisible by $n_2$ by induction hypothesis,
there exists $h_2 \in G$ such that $n_2 h_2 = h_1$.

::math-env-start{exercise}

The following are equivalent for a group $G$:
1. $G$ is divisible.
2. Every non-zero quotient of $G$ is infinite.
3. $G$ has no maximal proper subgroup.

::math-env-end{exercise}

::math-env-start{proof}

From 1 to 2:
If $G$ is divisible,
then for any non-zero quotient $H$ of $G$,
$H$ is divisible.
And by previous theorem, $H$ is a direct summand of $\mathbb{Q}$,
and $\mathbb{Z}(p^\infty)$,
thus $H$ is infinite.

From 2 to 3:
We assume $G$ has $H$ as a maximal proper subgroup,
and derive a contradiction.
As $H$ is maximal, $G/H$ is simple.
And by 2, $G/H$ is infinite.
Take $x \in G/H$, if $x$ has finite order,
then $\langle x \rangle$ is a proper subgroup of $G/H$,
contradicts the simplicity of $G/H$.
If $x$ has infinite order,
then $\langle 2x \rangle$ is a proper subgroup of $G/H$,
contradicts the simplicity of $G/H$.

From 3 to 1:
We assume that $G$ has no maximal proper subgroup,
and $G$ is now not divisible, and tries to derive a contradiction.
As $G$ is not divisible, then there exists $p$ such that $G \neq pG$.
And we assume $\varphi: G \rightarrow G/pG$ is the canonical map.
Then $G/pG[p] = G/pG$, obviously.
Thus, $G/pG$ is a vector space over $\mathbb{F}_p$,
we select a basis of $G/pG$, namely $\{x_1, x_2, \dots\}$.
Then, we define $\phi: G/pG \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_p$ by
$\phi(m_1 x_2 + m_2 x_2 + \dots) = m_1$. Then $\phi$ is a surjection.
And $\phi\varphi: G \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_p$ is a surjection.
Thus, $\ker{\phi\varphi}$ is a maximal proper subgroup of $G$,
which contradicts the assumption.

::math-env-end{proof}
