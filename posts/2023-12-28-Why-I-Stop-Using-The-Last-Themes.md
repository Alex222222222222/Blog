description: "Why I Stop Using The Last Themes"
---

If you visited my blog around three months ago,
you might recall the vibrant theme featuring fancy animations, colors,
and a rotating torus knot implemented with three.js.
While this theme garnered appreciation from friends and myself,
I've made a deliberate decision to move away from it.
The reasons are straightforward.

Managing and updating my blog became increasingly time-consuming
and complex as I added more features to the intricate design.
The simplicity I initially enjoyed was overshadowed
by the demands of maintaining such a detailed theme.

Crucially, my aesthetic preferences have
evolved towards a desire for simplicity.
I now advocate for a minimalist approachâ€”no need
for elaborate colors or animations.
I've realized the importance of focusing on
substance rather than the outward appearance.

I've spent considerable time on superficial aspects,
not just in my blog but in various facets of my life.
Now, my goal is to streamline the visual aspects and dedicate
more time to exploring profound and intellectually stimulating subjects,
such as algebraic topology.

Algebraic topology, with its intricate concepts, fascinates me.
I've observed individuals sharing visually striking
higher-dimensional objects online,
seemingly not mentioned the rich mathematical content behind the images.
I appreciate the beauty, but there's a deeper layer that goes unnoticed.

Sharing such images without delving into the underlying concepts on platforms
where few understand algebraic topology can come across as mere showmanship.
I aim to shift the focus from superficial displays
to a genuine appreciation for the intricate
and fascinating world of serious and interesting subjects.
