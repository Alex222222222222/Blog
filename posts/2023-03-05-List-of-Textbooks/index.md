Language: Chinese

Author: [Grigorii Fichtenholz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigorii_Fichtenholz)

Date of Publication: 2008

Area: Math, Mathematical Analysis

Review / Description: 

微积分学教程 is a Chinese translation of the original Russian textbook "Курс дифференциального и интегрального исчисления" (Course of Differential and Integral Calculus) by Grigorii Fichtenholz. The book is a comprehensive introduction to calculus and covers topics such as limits, derivatives, integrals, applications of calculus, and series.

The book is well-regarded by many mathematicians and educators, and is often used as a textbook for calculus courses in universities in Russia and China. The book is known for its clear and concise explanations, rigorous proofs, and wide range of examples and exercises.

One potential drawback of the book for some readers is that it is quite dense and may require a strong mathematical background to fully understand. Additionally, some readers may prefer a more modern approach to teaching calculus that incorporates more visual aids or real-world applications.

Overall, 微积分学教程 by Grigorii Fichtenholz is a highly respected textbook on calculus, and would likely be a valuable resource for students and educators looking to gain a deep understanding of the subject.

## Algebra

Name: Algebra

ISBN-10: 0132413779
ISBN-13: 9780132413770

Language: English

Author: [Michael Artin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Artin)

Date of Publication: 2010

Area: Math, Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra

Review / Description: 

Algebra is a comprehensive textbook on algebraic structures, including groups, rings, and fields. The book covers topics such as group actions, Galois theory, and homological algebra. The text is known for its clear and concise explanations, as well as its emphasis on geometric interpretations of algebraic concepts.

The book is well-regarded by many mathematicians and educators, and is often used as a textbook for advanced undergraduate or graduate-level courses in algebra. It is particularly popular among students and researchers interested in algebraic geometry and number theory.

One potential drawback of the book for some readers is that it may be too advanced for those without a strong mathematical background. Additionally, some readers may prefer a more traditional approach to algebra, rather than the geometric viewpoint presented in the book.

Overall, Algebra by Michael Artin is a highly respected textbook on algebra, and would likely be a valuable resource for students and educators looking to gain a deep understanding of the subject.
