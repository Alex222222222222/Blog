## GreenFiled The City In Minecraft

Greenfield was founded by `THEJESTR` back in August 2011. The map started with a single gas station, built by him, that still resides in its original form and location in `Hunterspoint`. In the last 11 years, he has led over 20 different staff members and 400+ builders to make the map what it is today.

Greenfield is a fictional city designed to resemble the West Coast of America, laboriously inspired by Los Angeles. Built to a one-to-one scale, every single building in Greenfield has substantial detail with carefully detailed elaborate surroundings. With a substantially sizable airport to lavish homes and businesses, Greenfield is one of the largest, most complex, and detailed original cities in Minecraft. As of July 2022, the in-progress map is now about 6500x8800 blocks, or about 57 square kilometers.
